# GitHub Actions
## Intrduction
This folder contains GitHub Actions to automate following things.
1) Test and build jave web application on root of this repo **javaWebApp**.
2) Build and push docker image of java web application to ECR.
3) Test, plan and apply Terraform code for provisioning infrastructure on AWS for hosting java web application.
4) Install helm chart on EKS cluster provisioned by Terraform to host java web application.
5) A manual trigger to uninstall helm chart and destroy whole provisioned infrastructure.

There are two workflows, First one is for provisioning and deployment. Which will be triggered automatically on push event to main branch. In which it will,
- **Build java web app**
- **Build and push docker image to ECR**
- **Test and plan Terraform code**
- **Apply Terraform code**
- **Install helm chart**

Second workflow is for uninstalling helm chart and destroy whole provisioned infrastructure. It can be triggered manually. In which it will,

- **Test and plan Terraform code**
- **Uninstall helm chart**
- **Perform Terraform destroy**

## Pre-Requisite
You will have to setup follwoing things to run this workflows.
1. Setup S3 bucket which will be used by Terraform backend to store state file. You will need S3 bucket's **name, key name and region**, later to configure GitHub action's variables.
2. Setup ECR in your AWS account on which you will be running these workflows. ECR will be used by app build workflow to push docker image and pods in EKS will pull image from there.
3. Create OIDC to connect AWS with GitHub. Do following steps to create OIDC provider in your AWS account.
    1. Go to **IAM** dashboard and form left pane select **Identity Providers**.
    2. On top right corner of page click on **Add Provider**.
    3. Now select **OpenID Connect**.
    4. In **Provider URL** add this ```https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com```.
    5. In **Audience** add this ```sts.amazonaws.com``` and click on **Add Provider**.
4. Create **IAM Role** and assign necessary permissions to it. This will be used by GitHub Actions to perform deployments on your AWS account. Use following steps to create IAM Role.
    1. Go to **IAM** dashboard and form left pane select **Roles**.
    2. On top right corner of page click on **Create Role**.
    3. Then select **Custom trust policy** and add follwoing policy. Replace place holders with your own accounts information.
    4. ```sh
        {
            "Version": "2008-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<aws account id>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
                    "Condition": {
                        "StringLike": {
                            "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:<github username>/<repo     name>:ref:refs/heads/<branch>"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<aws account id>:user/<aws account username>"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
    5. Click Next and on next window select all policies which are needed by your GitHub action workflow to perform operations on your AWS account. (For demo purpose you can select AdministratorAccess but in production this is not recommended)
    6. Then click next and give name to your role and create role. After creating role navigate to it and save it's ARN because it will be needed in GitHub Action's secrets.
5. Now Configure following secrets in your GitHub account. To see how to configure secrets, you can have a look on [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
    1. AWS_ROLE (add the arn of your AWS Role in secret which you have created above).
    2. ECR_URI (add just url of your ECR repo without repo name in secret. It will looks like this <account id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com)
    3. TF_VARS (add variables in secret like following which you want to override for default values. If you don't want to override any value so skip this.)
        ```sh
        var1=xyz
        var2=abc
        var3=123
        ```
6. Now configure following Variables in your GitHub account. To see how to configure secrets, you can have a look on [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/variables).
    1. AWS_BUCKET_NAME (add your S3 bucket name in value which you have created to store Terraform state file).
    2. AWS_BUCKET_KEY_NAME (add key name in value which you have created in your S3 bucket to store Terraform state file).
    3. AWS_REGION (add AWS account region in value on which operations will be perform e.g "us-east-1").
    4. CLUSTER_NAME (add any name in value which you want to assign to your EKS cluster e.g "demo-cluster")
    5. ECR_REPO (add ECR repo name in value which you have created to store docker image)
    6. HELM_REVISION_NAME (add any name in value which will be used by helm as a revisioning name e.g "test-deployment")

## Run it
### Deploy
Once all above Pre-Requisite steps are done you will be ready to give it a run.\
For that, push any small change in to main branch and deployment workflow will be triggered. Once that will complete successfully infrastructure will be provisioned on your AWS account and helm chart also will be deployed. To access java web app page you can locate an Application LoadBalancer in your AWS account, greb its DNS and access it in browser you should be able to see follwoing message.\
**Hi, This is Jawad's DevOps assessment.**\
### Destroy
To destroy whole infrastructure trigger workflow manually with value "destroy" and a second workflow to uninstall helm chart and destroy infrastructure will be triggered. After it will be completed successfully your AWS account will be cleaned.
